# Grid System
![Grid](/images/grid.png)

## Context
As part of the 3rd bachelor year’s curriculum, students of the Games Programming section of the school are tasked with creating a video-game over the span of 7 months (end of september to end of april). We settled on the creation of a city builder we’ve named Voliday which can be found here: https://volcanoteam.itch.io/

At the begining of the project I was tasked to investigate what solutions were available to implement a grid system in unreal engine 4.
