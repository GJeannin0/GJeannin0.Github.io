# Inspector Aer Editor Tool Technical Document

## Role

Window where the user can see and modify components and attributes of the scene's entities.

## Client

The tool will be used by the third year students to view and modify entities components in the neko engine.

## State of the tool

As of now only a part of the graphic interface is implemented.

![Inspector](/images/Insepctor.png)

It shows an exemple of how a transform component would be displayed.

## How does it work

It should select an entity via the Hierarchy, access its components and display each component of the entity on the interface.
For each component type the inspector displays a specific interface for each parameter to be modifiable

However the tool is currently incomplete, and the majority of this process isn't implemented yet.
